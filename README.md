----------------------------Grammer correction-------------------------------------
Grammer correction using Gramformer developed by the developer PrithivirajDamodaran
Gramformer has the potential to be used for preprocessing data. 
For example, you could use it to correct the grammar of your training, evaluation and testing data. 
This may improve the performance of whatever NLP task you're competing, such as text classification. 
With that said, Gramformer has the potential to not only help you with your own personal writing but also help improve the performance of your NLP systems


Gramformer is not available on PyPI. But, we can download it from its GitHub repo with the following line of code.
!pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Gramformer.git
